In this notebook we looked at one type of relational plot, scatter plots, but there are a bunch of other built in plots that will knock your socks off. One cool thing is that we can build linear regressions (i.e. fit a line to our data) directly through seaborn using the lmplot function (google or use the help docs to learn more). Make a plot of total bill vs tip and fit a line of best fit to it using the tips dataset. Can you do the same thing in a facet grid for each time of meal separately and also color the points/make separate lines for smokers/non-smokers in each sub-plot?"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Mskz65Sinxr5"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ov7jhWxtnxr6"},"source":["2. Let's play around with some different kinds of categorical plots. Make a violin plot to explore the relationship between being a smoker and tipping, colored by day of the week.

Go to the seaborn graph library (https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html) and find a plot we haven't looked at in class (i.e. dist plot, heat map, cluster plot) and make it using a dataset from seaborn. This is also a great workflow to use during your projects when you're trying to figure out interesting ways to look at your data or results!"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_dFsPdh5nxr8"},"outputs":[],"source":[""]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.1"},"colab":{"name":"W1D5 - Data Visualization Exercises.ipynb","provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
